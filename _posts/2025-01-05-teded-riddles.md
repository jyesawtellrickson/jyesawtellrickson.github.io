Misunderstands criteria, doesn't actually check answer, just says etc.
second attempt understand criteria a bit better, but still fails by not giving enough faces to one die, incorrectly calculating sums

Fails logic puzzle
Gets fairly close, but makes up a combination that doesn't exist 
"With just clues 1 and 2 (product=36, sum=13), Zara would see two possibilities:
(1,3,9) and (2,2,9)"
Then makes up a reason to eliminate based on criteria "After clue 3 (largest number appears once), (2,2,9) is eliminated because 9 only needs to appear once."

Gets dice problem correct
