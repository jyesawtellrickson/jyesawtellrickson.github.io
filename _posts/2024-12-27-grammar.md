TL;DR There are eight parts of speech: noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction and interjection. You should know this, and probably more.

We all learn grammar in school (if we paid attention), but most of us swiftly forget it. Do you know the difference between a conjuction and an interjection? 

While grammar can be thought of as a list of rules we need to follow to communicate effectively, it could also be thought of as a framework to describe the world. Something akin to the rules and regulations for an effective world model.

In that sense, I think it's valuable to have a deeper understanding of grammar and how it evolved.

[This link](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/english-grammar-101-all-you-need-to-know/) has a basic introduction to grammar as a quick refresher. I didn't find any AI-focused posts on it in my quick search - it  would be nice to see!
