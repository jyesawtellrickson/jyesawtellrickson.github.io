Merry Christmas from OpenAI: "o3 is coming, and it's better than all your models!" 


# o3 is coming

As a part of their annual announcements, OpenAI [shared](https://openai.com/12-days/) their latest model: o3 (skipping o2 due to UK's big telco). TL;DR it seems we got the new step-change people were doubting. Of course, nothing is published, nothing is available, but they do share some key results.

I've long been interested in Chollet's [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://openai.com/12-days/) and the associated ARC challenge. Just a few weeks before this announcement a competition called ARC Prize included with some nice results, but nothing astounding. o3 has suddenly come in and taken the prize, by a big margin.

Chollet himself has done a [nice write-up](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough) of the experiments they ran. Most notably, they achieve an accuracy of 88% with a high-compute, tuned model, vs. o1's 32% and the SOTA's 60%. 

But what did it cost? A cool USD$3500 per task. Yes, per task. So for 100 tasks (the semi-private dataset) that's a casual USD$350K. 

You thought o1 is pricey. o3 also breaks all benchmarks with pricing.

Notably, they also tested a low compute version, which comes in at $20 per task which is a lot more reasonable and at least closer to the order of magnitude of human cost.

# What this means

The key question: is this AGI? No. At least according to Chollet. Based on their tests, o3 still makes silly mistakes a human would not. Empirically, it's not the same kind of intelligence as human intelligence. So there are still steps to go, we're not quite there yet, but we might be getting awfully close.

With o3 coming soon, should we give up other avenues? Probably not. o3 is still limited on it's own. It's expensive and inefficient, it still needs to integrate with tools effectively (e.g. coding), it needs to be able to evolve and understand long context windows, etc. 

There's still a lot of interesting research to be done. 


# Time to play?

It will likely be six months before it's released to the public (based off the history), so don't expect to have access soon (unless you're a safety researcher).

Even o1 (non-preview) is not yet available to many users.
